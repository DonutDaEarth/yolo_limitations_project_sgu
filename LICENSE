ACADEMIC USE NOTICE:

This project is designed for educational purposes as part of a university
Pattern Recognition & Image Processing course. The code provides a framework
for analyzing object detection models, but students are expected to:

1. Run their own experiments and collect unique data
2. Perform their own analysis and draw conclusions
3. Write their own reports and presentations
4. Understand and be able to explain all code components

The framework handles mechanics; students provide scientific analysis.

Third-party dependencies (PyTorch, YOLO, Detectron2) are subject to their
